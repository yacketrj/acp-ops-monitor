#
# Usage: bash check-upstream-prs.sh
#
# Release-tag detection (added 2026-07-25): this script previously had no
# visibility into real upstream (Red-Blink) cutting a new release -- it
# only ever watched PR open/merge events on repos this account has PRs
# against. That gap meant a real upstream release (v1.3.65, published
# 2026-07-24) went completely undetected by this hourly monitor, and was
# only discovered manually, well after the fact, during unrelated incident
# response work. check_upstream_release() below closes that gap using the
# same state-cache-diff + Discord-notify-on-transition pattern already
# used for PR merges in check_repo(), so a human doesn't need to
# separately remember to poll `timeout 60 gh release list` on any tracked upstream.

# REFACTOR (2026-07-24): the original version called `python3 -c` once PER
# PR to read from OLD_STATE_JSON and once PER PR to merge into NEW_STATE_JSON
# — O(n) subprocess spawns for what should be O(1) reads/writes. Refactored
# to: (1) do a single python3 call up front to flatten OLD_STATE_JSON into a
# bash associative array for O(1) in-process lookups, and (2) accumulate new
# state entries into a second associative array, serialized to JSON with a
# single python3 call at the very end. This is both faster (fewer process
# spawns under `set -e` + subshell overhead) and more robust (no risk of a
# mid-loop python3 failure silently dropping a state update via the `||
# echo "$NEW_STATE"` fallback the old version relied on).

# array expansion without an index as referencing the unset [0]
# element in this context) and would have written the literal word
# "NEW_STATE" to the cache file even if it hadn't errored. Serialize it
# to JSON (tab-separated key/value pairs piped to python3, mirroring
# how OLD_STATE_JSON is parsed back into OLD_STATE above) instead of
