# BUG FIX (2026-07-23): the original unconditional
# `if [ "$UPSTREAM" != "$ORIGIN_MAIN" ]` below does not check *direction* —
# it fires identically whether origin/main is genuinely behind upstream, OR
# origin/main is AHEAD (has fork-local merged work upstream doesn't have
# yet), OR the two have diverged. Combined with the unconditional
# `git reset --hard upstream/main` + force-push a few lines down, this
# silently destroyed three merged PRs on this fork's main in a single day
# (#103, #104, #108) — each time a PR merged into origin/main, the very
# next hourly run saw a SHA mismatch and reset origin/main straight back to
# upstream/main, discarding the merge with no warning. Fast-forwarding a
# genuinely-behind fork is safe; resetting an ahead-or-diverged fork is
# not. Only treat this as a sync-needed case when upstream/main is NOT
# already reachable from origin/main's history AND origin/main has no
# commits of its own that upstream/main lacks (i.e. origin/main is a pure
# ancestor of upstream/main — the fork is strictly, only behind).
#
# BUG FIX (2026-07-25): the AHEAD_OF_UPSTREAM=0 guard above is necessary
# but not sufficient. It only asks "is origin/main ahead of upstream/main
# *right now*" -- but the actual destructive operation on the next line
# was `git reset --hard upstream/main`, which throws away any commit on
# origin/main that ISN'T reachable from upstream/main, REGARDLESS of
# whether the guard's snapshot-in-time check happened to read AHEAD=0.
# This fork now permanently carries real, fork-only history (incident
# reports, PR merges that will never be upstreamed, etc.) on every real
# commit going forward -- there is no longer a safe moment to blindly
# reset this repo's main to a third-party ref, only a safe moment to
# FAST-FORWARD it. Confirmed via reflog forensics on 2026-07-25 that this
# exact reset call (or a manual reproduction of the same command pattern)
# did in fact wipe a local checkout of main back to upstream/main's raw
# tip, discarding 26 real, already-pushed fork commits from the local
# working copy (origin/main on GitHub was thankfully unaffected, since
# the destructive command ran before this fix, on a checkout that hadn't
# been re-pushed yet -- but the force-push on the very next line would
# have made that loss permanent and remote if it had run one line later).
# Replaced `git reset --hard upstream/main` with `git merge --ff-only
# upstream/main`: identical outcome when genuinely, purely behind (the
# only case this guard is meant to allow), but merge --ff-only REFUSES to
# run at all the instant local history has diverged even slightly --
# it fails loudly and non-destructively instead of silently discarding
# commits, which is the correct failure mode for an unattended hourly
# cron job touching a repo's main branch.

  #
  # BUG FIX (2026-08-15): "must never auto-sync" (correct, unchanged
  # above) had silently become "must never even mention it again" --
  # this branch logged one green line, forever, no matter how large
  # $BEHIND grew or how long it had been growing, with zero threshold
  # and zero use of $BEHIND (which was already computed above, just
  # never read here). Confirmed via a real, concrete case this let
  # through undetected: our own upstream PR #134 (RBAC/IAM policy
  # engine) merged into Red-Blink/dune-awakening-selfhost-docker on
  # 2026-08-11; the maintainer made a real follow-up fix on top of it
  # shortly after that this fork's main never pulled back down. By the
  # time this was found independently (dune-awakening-selfhost-docker
  # #279), the fork was 162 commits ahead / 150 behind, with real,
  # security-relevant divergence across ~13 files -- and this monitor
  # had reported "OK... by design" on every single one of those hourly
  # runs, despite already knowing the exact behind-count each time.
  # "Ahead-only, never behind" genuinely doesn't need a human -- that
  # really is the healthy, by-design case the comment above describes.
  # "Ahead AND behind" means real upstream commits exist that this
  # fork's main hasn't reconciled, which needs a human to actually look
  # at, not a green log line. Mirrors the exact state-file-dedup +
  # gh issue create pattern already used by the release-detection block
  # above (section 0), so a fresh divergence is reported once, not every
  # hour forever, and a GROWING divergence (BEHIND increasing since last
  # report) re-notifies rather than staying silent just because an issue
  # was already filed once for a smaller gap.
  #
  # BUG FIX (2026-08-17, acp-ops-monitor#33): the state file above only
  # ever recorded the last-reported BEHIND count, never the GitHub issue
  # number it was reported on. That meant every time BEHIND grew, this
  # branch called `gh issue create` again -- filing a brand new issue
  # instead of updating the one already open for the same underlying,
  # still-unreconciled divergence. Confirmed in the wild: #289, #297,
  # #298, #300 (and later #310, #312, #314) were four/seven separate
  # open issues describing the exact same problem at different
  # snapshots, none of which this script ever closed even after #279/#316
  # actually reconciled the fork. Fixed by storing "BEHIND ISSUE_NUMBER"
  # in the state file: a growing count now COMMENTS on the existing open
  # issue (falling back to creating one only if none is tracked, or the
  # tracked one is no longer open) instead of creating a new one, and the
  # BEHIND==0 (resolved) path now closes the tracked issue with a
  # resolution comment instead of just silently going green.
